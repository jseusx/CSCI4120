# Repository with all assignments from machine learning class
Navigate through it by using the appropriate folders.
For most if not all projects, you will need to install everything inside "requirements.txt"
<br>
If you are on a linux device, you can use pip to install them all:
```console
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Additionally, all folders will have their own seperate README's with instructions on how to run the programs.
